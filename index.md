I am an AR/VR researcher with a passion for exploring the natural perception and interaction of users in virtual environments. My goal is to continue pushing the boundaries of VR research to develop new and innovative solutions that benefit individuals and society as a whole. I am fascinated by the potential for VR to provide new and unique experiences, and I am dedicated to exploring its potential to improve our daily lives. I am always eager to collaborate with others and learn from different perspectives.

I am currently based at the Perception & Interaction Lab (PILab) at the Department of Informatics, Bioengineering, Robotics and Systems Engineering (DIBRIS) at the University of Genoa, Italy where I am currently carrying out my postdoctoral reserach activities.
