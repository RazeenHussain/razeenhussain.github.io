I am an AR/VR researcher with a passion for exploring the natural perception and interaction of users in virtual environments. My goal is to continue pushing the boundaries of VR research to develop new and innovative solutions that benefit individuals and society as a whole. I am fascinated by the potential for VR to provide new and unique experiences, and I am dedicated to exploring its potential to improve our daily lives. I am always eager to collaborate with others and learn from different perspectives.
